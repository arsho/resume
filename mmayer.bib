abstract="An effective application framework design for e-governance is definitely a challenging task. The majority of the prior research has focused on designing e-governance architecture where people identity verification takes long time using manual verification system. We develop an efficient application framework that verifies peoples identity. It provides cloud based REST API using deep learning based recognition approach and stores face meta data in neural networks for rapid facial recognition. After each successful identity verification, we store the facial data in the neural network if there is a match between 80--95{\%}. This decreases the error rate in each iteration and enhance the network. Finally, our system is compared with the existing system on the basis of CPU utilization, error rate and cost metrics to show the novelty of this framework. We implement and evaluate our proposed framework which allows any organization and institute to verify people identity in a reliable and secure manner.",
